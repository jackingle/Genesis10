# Introduction

This repository is for a project completed during the hiring process for
Genesis10.  Genesis10 asks that applicants complete a two-week course in
HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to display their ability to learn.

The important work is located in the portfolio folder.  The Lucky Sevens
subfolder carries one project.  The other project is an example restaurant
website.  These projects have been kept together in the form in which 
they were submitted.  

## Lucky Sevens

Lucky Sevens is a gambling game designed to show the futility of gambling
according to house rules.  The player makes a bet on the web page and the game continues until the pool of money reaches 0.  

If the player rolls a 7, they win $4.  For all other results, they lose $1.  A table displays the starting bet, total rolls before going broke, highest amount won, and the roll count at highest amount won.

## Restaurant Website

The restaurant website consists of index, menu, and contact pages.  The entire website is bootstrap optimized.  The contact page has Javascript based form validation.  

## Additional Information

This project could be improved with Flask and Jinja2.  

The Exercises folder has a few examples of course content for reference.
